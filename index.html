    <h1>Running Songs Lyrics</h1>

    <h2>ðŸŽµ Song 1: "Run Free"</h2>
    <p>
        Run free in the open sky,<br>
        Feet to the rhythm, never asking why.<br>
        Heartbeat pounding with every stride,<br>
        Running wild, I feel alive.
    </p>

    <h2>ðŸŽµ Song 2: "Keep On Moving"</h2>
    <p>
        Step by step, I chase the sun,<br>
        Wonâ€™t stop now, Iâ€™ve just begun.<br>
        No looking back, I face the wind,<br>
        Keep on moving, â€˜til the end.
    </p>

    <h2>ðŸŽµ Song 3: "The Long Run"</h2>
    <p>
        Itâ€™s a long road, but I wonâ€™t fall,<br>
        Pushing forward, I hear the call.<br>
        Every breath, a beat in time,<br>
        The long runâ€™s victory is mine.
    </p>
